Fill the data and click on *Save* if you want to create the profile.

== Installed versions

The installed versions subsection allows you to manage the different versions of devonfw-ide available.

* It lists the devonfw-ide you have installed in your system, along with the ones available for download from our maven repository.
* If you want a specific version, you can search it here and *DOWNLOAD* it.
* To check the release notes for a version, simply click on *Consolidated list of features*
* For the installed versions:
** You can view it in your system explorer by clicking the eye icon.
** You can update its settings and softwares by clicking on *UPDATE*.
** You can also *UNINSTALL* an installed version, after which the devonfw dashboard will no longer keep track of the Projects and IDEs belonging to that version
